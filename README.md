# Introducing AFQ-Insight

This is the technical description of AFQ-Insight, a tool for
multidimensional analysis and detection of informative features
in diffusion MRI measurements of human white matter. It includes
applications in the study of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and
aging.

## Prerequisites

### Docker-based installation

We recommend that you use the supplied docker image to reproduce the results of this paper.
To build the docker image, type
```bash
make docker-build
```

After that, you can run the jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory by typing
```bash
make docker-lab
```
and then navigating to the URL supplied in the output of that command. When you're done,
type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> (twice to confirm) to return to your host machine shell.

If you want to obtain an interactive shell in the Docker image, type
```bash
make docker-shell
```

When you're done, type `exit` to return to your host machine shell.

### Docker-less installation

If you don't want to use Docker, you must have Python (>=
3.7) installed. If you don't already have Python installed, we recommend
the free [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

You will then need to install dependencies using either
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```bash
conda env create
conda activate afq-insight-paper
```

## Data

To download the source data for the ALS and WH datasets mentioned in the paper, type
```bash
make data
```

The other datasets require data usage agreements and so cannot be shared via this repository.
